# DEAR VIEWER
# OwnProjects
This repo consists of my own small projects. Everything in this repo is WIP, and not meant for public distribution, only for recruiters and other selected individuals.

Here's a list of things I've learned while working on projects that have ended up here. Learning reports of sorts.

TwitterBot:
  - More experience with Python
  - More experience with everyday programming challenges, such as string manipulation, file manipulation etc.
  - Learning the usage of API's
  - Learning GIT-workflow
  - Learning the use of keys, and learning ways to store keys more securely.
